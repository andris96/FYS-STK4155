    "The aim of the exercises this week is to train the neural network you implemented last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train neural networks, we use gradient descent, since there is no analytical expression for the optimal parameters. This means you will need to compute the gradient of the cost function wrt. the network parameters. And then you will need to implement some gradient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by computing gradients for a network with one layer, then two layers, then any number of layers. Keeping track of the shapes and doing things step by step will be very important this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you do the exercises this week by editing and running this notebook file, as it includes some checks along the way that you have implemented the neural network correctly, and running small parts of the code at a time will be important for understanding the methods. If you have trouble running a notebook, you can run this notebook in google colab instead(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FfvbN0XlhV-lATRPyGRTtTBnJr3zNuHL#offline=true&sandboxMode=true), though we recommend that you set up VSCode and your python environment to run code like this locally.\n",
